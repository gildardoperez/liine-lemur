### ABOUT
Liine is a group of people passionate about music and technology. Our long-term goal is to redefine the way people interact with sound. Liine was founded in 2010 by Etienne Noreau-Hébert, Gareth Williams, John Acquaviva, Mark Quail, Nicolas Bougaïeff and Richie Hawtin.

### EVOLUTION OF CONTROL
Lemur, the professional MIDI and OSC controller app that doesn't cut any corners, has evolved. Now easier to use than ever, more customisable and with more out-of-the-box functionality. Any software or hardware that receives MIDI or OSC can be controlled by Lemur. Control DJ software, live electronic music performance software, studio production software (DAWs), VJ software, visual synthesis software, stage lighting and more.

### CANVAS
Canvas is a brand new object that lets you script custom widgets with full multitouch support. The object is adapted from the HTML5 Canvas element, which means you can design widgets featuring complex shapes, animation, shadows, and transparency

### SEQUENCER
Lemur 5.0 introduced a family of new features for tight sequencing. This includes three new objects: StepNote, StepSwitch and StepSlider. Each of these provides a different flavour of sequencing and is ready to use right out of the box. The objects do the hard work for you, simple add them to your template and they are ready to control your MIDI instruments.

### IN APP EDITOR
Design your templates on the fly, without a computer in sight. The In-App Editor makes multitouch control truly improvisatory by letting you shape your controller the same way you shape sounds. Best of all – it’s easier to use than ever. The In App Editor is accessible when you use Lemur on iPad.

### SKINS
Lemur features three new skins, in addition to the classic look. Choose the look that fits your style and get inspired.

### ROCK SOLID STANDARD
Countless artists, from bedroom producers to major stadium-touring acts use Lemur to create and perform. Lemur software benefits from nearly 10 years of development, and has been fine-tuned to provide maximum performance on iPad. Whether you're connecting over a hardware MIDI adaptor (iOS only) or over Wi-Fi, Lemur gets the message across flawlessly.

### USER LIBRARY
Access templates from top artists and the Lemur community. Some of these are actual templates used on stage, others are pure studio or creative tools. Share your own or simply browse the library and download whatever suits your needs.
